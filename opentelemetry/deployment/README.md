# OpenTelemetry Deployment Guide

> Deploy, connect, scale, secure, and upgrade OpenTelemetry Collectors without turning the telemetry path into an unmonitored production dependency.

| [01_deployment_decisions.md](01_deployment_decisions.md) | Architecture and artifacts | Choose direct, agent, gateway, or agent-to-gateway; select Core, Contrib, Kubernetes, or a custom distribution; decide whether the Operator is justified. |
| [02_docker_compose.md](02_docker_compose.md) | Docker | Run and validate a pinned Collector image locally, expose only required ports, and understand what must change before production. |
| [03_kubernetes_installation.md](03_kubernetes_installation.md) | Kubernetes | Install with the upstream Helm chart or Operator, configure secrets, resources, probes, Services, disruption controls, and production-safe defaults. |
| [04_service_discovery_and_clients.md](04_service_discovery_and_clients.md) | Connectivity | Find Collector workloads and Services, choose the correct OTLP endpoint for each topology, configure applications, and verify end-to-end delivery. |
| [05_scaling_and_resilience.md](05_scaling_and_resilience.md) | Capacity and reliability | Scale stateless pipelines, isolate stateful processors, route tail-sampled traces correctly, size queues, and distinguish Collector saturation from backend saturation. |
| [06_security_operations_and_upgrades.md](06_security_operations_and_upgrades.md) | Operations | Protect trust boundaries, monitor the Collector itself, handle incidents, roll out configuration safely, and use a go-live checklist. |

## 🧭 Reading Order

1. **Deployment decisions** — decide what you are deploying and why.
2. **Docker Compose** — prove the Collector config and backend credentials in a small environment.
3. **Kubernetes installation** — convert the proven config into managed cluster resources.
4. **Service discovery and clients** — make workloads send to the right endpoint.
5. **Scaling and resilience** — add replicas and buffering without breaking stateful processing.
6. **Security, operations, and upgrades** — make the telemetry path supportable over time.

## 🗺️ Recommended Starting Point

For a typical Kubernetes environment:

```text
application SDKs
  -> ClusterIP Service on 4317 or 4318
  -> 3 stateless gateway Collector replicas
  -> authenticated, encrypted backend endpoint
```

Use the upstream **Collector Helm chart** unless the platform already operates
the OpenTelemetry Operator or needs its auto-instrumentation, sidecar injection,
or Target Allocator features. Add a DaemonSet tier only for node-local
collection such as container logs, host metrics, or a required local telemetry
hop. Add a separate trace-aware routing and sampling tier before enabling tail
sampling at scale.

## 📌 Prerequisites

- [OpenTelemetry concepts](../01_concepts.md) — signals, SDKs, exporters, and Collector pipelines.
- [Production architecture](../03_production_architecture.md) — processors, routing, redaction, sampling, and backend responsibilities.
- Access to the backend's documented OTLP endpoint, protocol, TLS requirements, authentication scheme, and quotas.
- For Kubernetes: a namespace, a secret-management path, resource quotas, NetworkPolicy support, and a way to scrape Collector internal metrics.
