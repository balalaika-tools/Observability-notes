# OpenTelemetry Guide

OpenTelemetry is the vendor-neutral instrumentation layer for modern distributed systems. It gives you a standard way to create traces, metrics, logs, context propagation, and telemetry pipelines without tying application code to a single backend.

This section is a beginner-to-production guide. It starts with the mental model, then moves into Python examples, multi-service propagation, metrics, production collector patterns, deployment, alerting, and the GenAI conventions used by LLM and agent systems.

## 📐 When To Use OpenTelemetry Directly

Use raw OpenTelemetry instrumentation when:

- you have multiple services, languages, or telemetry backends;
- you already run an OpenTelemetry Collector;
- you need infrastructure and application metrics alongside LLM traces;
- you want traces to go to Langfuse and metrics/logs to observability backends such as Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, Honeycomb, or Elastic;
- you need vendor-neutral instrumentation in libraries or shared internal frameworks.

Use the Langfuse SDK when:

- your main goal is LLM observability, prompt/version tracking, and evaluation;
- you are writing Python or JS/TS application code and want higher-level helpers for generations, scores, and attribute propagation;
- you still want OpenTelemetry compatibility but do not want to wire OTLP exporters manually.

A production LLM system may use both APIs, but each process still needs one
trace-provider ownership path. Either let the Langfuse SDK initialize the
provider and add general OpenTelemetry instrumentation to it, or initialize the
provider yourself and attach the Langfuse span processor/exporter. Do not let
two independent bootstraps replace the global provider or export the same span
twice.

```text
Application code
  |-- Langfuse SDK or GenAI instrumentation for LLM traces
  |-- OpenTelemetry SDK/instrumentations for HTTP, DB, queues, metrics, logs
       |
       v
OpenTelemetry Collector
  |-- traces -> Langfuse and/or APM backend
  |-- metrics -> Prometheus-compatible metrics backend
  |-- logs -> log backend
```

## 📌 Official References Used

This guide was checked on July 20, 2026. Core semantic-convention guidance is
anchored to `v1.43.0`; the faster-moving GenAI material is separately anchored
to `open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai` commit
`c26a2c21d1ee70d5231bd440c7b48d3c94ee506a` from 2026-07-17. Keep both anchors:
the dedicated GenAI repository can change without a new core release.
