# Evaluation, Metrics, and Alerting

Last verified against official Langfuse evaluation and metrics documentation on 2026-07-20.

## 🧭 Mental Model

Langfuse turns traces into AI engineering feedback loops. The loop is:

1. Observe production behavior.
2. Score important traces.
3. Build datasets from representative examples.
4. Run experiments against candidate changes.
5. Promote the best version.
6. Watch quality, latency, cost, and volume after release.

The mental model is "observe, judge, preserve, compare, release, monitor":

```text
production trace
  -> score from user, code, human, or judge
  -> representative trace becomes dataset item
  -> experiment compares candidate versions
  -> release gate decides whether to ship
  -> Langfuse metrics and external alerts watch production
```

Langfuse evaluation solves quality measurement and iteration for LLM workflows. It does not make judges automatically correct, replace human review for high-stakes domains, or provide continuous paging by itself. Use external metrics/incident systems for operational alerts and use Langfuse as the quality and trace investigation system.

## 🧪 Scores

Scores are the core metric primitive for quality. They can come from users, humans, code, or model-based evaluators.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()


def score_active_trace(relevance: float, accepted: bool) -> None:
    langfuse.score_current_trace(
        name="answer_relevance",
        value=relevance,
        data_type="NUMERIC",
    )
    langfuse.score_current_trace(
        name="user_accepted",
        value=1 if accepted else 0,
        data_type="BOOLEAN",
    )
```

Out-of-band scoring:

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()


def record_judge_score(trace_id: str, score_id: str, value: float) -> None:
    langfuse.create_score(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        score_id=score_id,
        name="groundedness",
        value=value,
        data_type="NUMERIC",
        comment="Automated groundedness judge",
        metadata={"judge": "groundedness-v3"},
    )
```

Use deterministic score IDs for idempotency. A good pattern is:

```text
<trace_id>:<score_name>:<evaluator_version>
```

Layered explanation:

- Beginner intuition: a score is a judgment attached to a trace, observation, session, or dataset run.
- Technical mechanics: a score has a name, value, data type, optional comment, optional metadata, and an attachment target.
- Production implications: score names and rubrics become dashboard and release-gate contracts.
- Common mistakes: changing score semantics without versioning, duplicating scores on retries, and mixing feedback, labels, and measurements under one name.

## 📐 Choosing Score Types

| Need | Score type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Continuous quality | `NUMERIC` | relevance `0.81` |
| Pass/fail | `BOOLEAN` | safe answer `1` |
| Discrete label | `CATEGORICAL` | `"correct"`, `"partial"`, `"incorrect"` |
| Reviewer note | `TEXT` | `"cites stale source"` |

Use `BOOLEAN` values as `0` or `1`. Use `TEXT` for qualitative notes, not aggregate metrics; free-form text is not useful for score analytics or experiment comparisons in the same way numeric, boolean, and categorical scores are.

Decision points:

| Need | Use | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aggregate a trend | `NUMERIC` or `BOOLEAN` | `TEXT` |
| Enforce a rubric | Score config | Ad hoc value names |
| Explain a score | `comment` or score metadata | New score names for every explanation |
| Classify failure cause | `CATEGORICAL` score | Tags added after the fact |
| Capture open-ended review | `TEXT` score | Cramming prose into categorical values |

## 🏷️ Score Configs

Score configs standardize scoring across a team. They define score names, data types, and optional constraints such as numeric ranges or allowed categories.

Use score configs when:

- multiple humans or evaluators produce the same score name;
- annotation queues should present a fixed rubric;
- dashboards compare scores across releases;
- you want invalid score values rejected instead of silently polluting analytics.

Score configs are required for annotation queues and optional for programmatic SDK/API scoring. Create and manage them in the Langfuse UI under project score/evaluation settings, or via the Langfuse API when you need automation.

> ⚠️ **Watch out:** Changing a score's value range or semantics without versioning silently corrupts all historical dashboard averages and experiment comparisons that rely on that score name.

Practical score config examples:

| Score | Type | Suggested constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `answer_relevance` | `NUMERIC` | `0.0` to `1.0` |
| `groundedness` | `NUMERIC` | `0.0` to `1.0` |
| `user_accepted` | `BOOLEAN` | `0` or `1` |
| `failure_category` | `CATEGORICAL` | `"retrieval"`, `"prompt"`, `"tool"`, `"policy"`, `"provider"` |
| `review_notes` | `TEXT` | free-form reviewer comment |

Layered explanation:

- Beginner intuition: score configs are rubrics with guardrails.
- Technical mechanics: configs define data type and constraints; they are required for annotation workflows and optional for SDK/API scoring.
- Production implications: configs prevent dashboards from comparing incompatible values.
- Common mistakes: creating a config after scores already diverged, archiving without documenting migration, and using one generic `quality` score for unrelated workflows.

## 👤 User Feedback

User feedback should land on the trace the user actually saw.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()


def submit_feedback(trace_id: str, thumbs_up: bool, comment: str | None = None) -> None:
    langfuse.create_score(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        name="user_feedback",
        value=1 if thumbs_up else 0,
        data_type="BOOLEAN",
        comment=comment,
    )
```

Store the Langfuse trace ID with the response payload or conversation message so the feedback endpoint can attach the score later.

> 💡 **Key insight:** User feedback must be attached to the trace the user actually saw — if you don't store and return the trace ID with the response, there is no reliable way to link it later.

Feedback lifecycle:

1. Root trace starts while generating the answer.
2. Application returns the answer and stores/returns `langfuse_trace_id`.
3. User submits thumbs up/down, rating, or comment later.
4. Feedback endpoint creates a score on that exact trace.
5. Low feedback traces feed annotation queues, dashboards, and datasets.

Common mistakes:

- Attaching feedback to the current request instead of the original answer trace.
- Storing raw user email as score metadata.
- Treating one negative answer as a page instead of alerting on sustained trends.

## 🛠️ Code Evaluators

Use deterministic code for checks that do not require judgment:

- JSON schema validity
- citation format
- required fields present
- no empty answer
- all tool calls completed
- grounded citation IDs exist in retrieved documents

```python
import json

from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()


def score_json_validity(trace_id: str, output: str) -> None:
    try:
        json.loads(output)
        valid = 1
        comment = "Valid JSON"
    except ValueError as exc:
        valid = 0
        comment = str(exc)

    langfuse.create_score(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        score_id=f"{trace_id}:json_valid:v1",
        name="json_valid",
        value=valid,
        data_type="BOOLEAN",
        comment=comment,
    )
```

Layered explanation:

- Beginner intuition: code evaluators are reliable checks for rules a program can verify.
- Technical mechanics: they run in your app, worker, Langfuse evaluator, or experiment process and create scores.
- Production implications: use them for CI gates, safety checks, schema checks, citation checks, and regression tests.
- Common mistakes: using an LLM judge for deterministic checks, not versioning evaluator logic, and failing to make evaluator retries idempotent.

## 🧪 LLM-as-Judge

Use model judges for fuzzy judgments, but treat them as evaluators that need validation.

Good judge dimensions:

- answer relevance
- groundedness
- instruction following
- helpfulness
- safety policy compliance
- tone

Practical rules:

- Keep judge prompts versioned.
- Calibrate against human-reviewed examples.
- Store judge model and prompt version in score metadata.
- Prefer numeric or categorical rubrics over free-form only.
- Run judge scoring asynchronously when latency matters.
- Avoid scoring the judge with the same context that produced the original answer if that creates bias.
- Prefer observation-level evaluators for production monitoring when the question is about a specific generation, retrieval, tool, or guardrail observation.
- Use trace-level evaluators only when the judge truly needs the full multi-step workflow context.
- Use experiments for controlled offline comparisons before release.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()


def record_llm_judge(trace_id: str, groundedness: float, explanation: str) -> None:
    langfuse.create_score(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        score_id=f"{trace_id}:groundedness:judge-v4",
        name="groundedness",
        value=groundedness,
        data_type="NUMERIC",
        comment=explanation,
        metadata={"judge": "judge-v4", "rubric": "groundedness-2026-06"},
    )
```

Production targeting guidance:

| Target | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| Observation | Evaluate one operation, such as final answer helpfulness, retrieval relevance, toxicity, or tool result quality |
| Trace | Evaluate an end-to-end workflow that needs context across retrieval, tools, generation, and guardrails |
| Experiment | Compare prompt, model, retrieval, or code variants on a controlled dataset |

Observation-level evaluators are usually faster and cheaper for production monitoring because they avoid judging entire traces when only one operation matters.

Judge quality controls:

- Keep a human-reviewed calibration set.
- Track judge prompt version, model, temperature, and rubric in metadata.
- Measure disagreement with humans and review drift after model changes.
- Avoid using the same model/prompt family as both answerer and judge when independence matters.
- Prefer categorical rubrics for failure class and numeric rubrics for quality trend.
- Budget judge cost separately from production answer cost.

## 👤 Human Annotation

Human review is still the anchor for high-stakes quality work. Use it to calibrate LLM-as-judge prompts, review edge cases, and build gold datasets.

Annotation queues are the Langfuse workflow for assigning traces, observations, or sessions to domain experts. Reviewers add scores and comments using score configs.

Use annotation queues for:

- reviewing low-score or high-risk traces;
- sampling production traffic for quality audits;
- collecting corrected outputs;
- aligning humans and LLM judges;
- creating gold examples for datasets;
- reviewing safety or compliance-sensitive cases.

Recommended workflow:

1. Define score configs for the rubric.
2. Add traces, observations, or sessions to an annotation queue.
3. Assign reviewers or domain experts.
4. Reviewers score and comment on each item.
5. Compare human scores against automated judge scores.
6. Promote representative reviewed traces into datasets.

Track inter-rater reliability when more than one reviewer scores the same examples. For categorical labels, compare agreement rates. For numeric scores, track average disagreement and review outliers. Reconcile unclear rubric language before using the scores as a release gate.

Layered explanation:

- Beginner intuition: human annotation is the source of truth for nuanced quality.
- Technical mechanics: reviewers use annotation queues and score configs to score traces, observations, or sessions.
- Production implications: human labels calibrate judges, define gold datasets, and make release gates credible.
- Common mistakes: unclear rubrics, unbalanced samples, no second-review process, and reviewing only failures without common successful cases.

## 📁 Datasets

Datasets turn production examples into regression tests.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

langfuse.create_dataset(
    name="support-rag-regression",
    description="Representative support RAG cases and historical failures",
    metadata={"owner": "ai-platform", "domain": "support"},
)

langfuse.create_dataset_item(
    dataset_name="support-rag-regression",
    input={"question": "How do I reset SSO for my workspace?"},
    expected_output={"must_cite": ["sso-admin-guide"]},
    metadata={"source": "production_failure", "priority": "high"},
    source_trace_id="9d1b6c3e7f9a4d8bb1e2c3a4f5d6e7a8",
)
```

Use datasets for:

- top user workflows
- historical regressions
- safety cases
- edge cases
- important tenants or account types
- model migration tests

Dataset best practices:

- Include both common workflows and hard edge cases.
- Preserve the production source trace when a dataset item came from a real failure.
- Keep expected outputs structured enough for evaluators to use.
- Version prompts, retrieval strategy, model, and code in experiment metadata.
- Add newly discovered failure modes continuously.
- Keep personally identifiable or sensitive data out of reusable datasets unless your governance model explicitly allows it.

Layered explanation:

- Beginner intuition: a dataset is your memory of examples the system must handle.
- Technical mechanics: dataset items have input, optional expected output, metadata, optional schema validation, and optional source trace/observation links.
- Production implications: datasets let you compare changes before rollout and reproduce historical failures.
- Common mistakes: using raw production dumps, leaving expected outputs vague, forgetting source trace IDs, and not versioning the dataset state used for a release decision.

## 📁 Experiments

Use experiments to compare prompt, model, retrieval, or agent changes before production rollout.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

from langfuse import Evaluation, get_client

langfuse = get_client()
version_timestamp = datetime(2026, 7, 1, 12, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(
    name="support-rag-regression",
    version=version_timestamp,
)


def task(*, item, **kwargs):
    return answer_question(item.input["question"], prompt_version="prompt-v18")


def evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata=None):
    cited = set(output.get("citations", []))
    expected = set(expected_output.get("must_cite", []))
    return Evaluation(
        name="required_citations_present",
        value=1 if expected.issubset(cited) else 0,
        data_type="BOOLEAN",
    )


result = langfuse.run_experiment(
    name="support-rag-regression",
    run_name="prompt-v18",
    data=dataset.items,
    task=task,
    evaluators=[evaluator],
    metadata={"candidate": "prompt-v18"},
)
```

Keep experiment names and run names stable enough that dashboards and release notes can compare them over time.

For datasets hosted in Langfuse, you can also run from the dataset client so the run is automatically linked to the dataset in the UI:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()
version_timestamp = datetime(2026, 7, 1, 12, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(
    name="support-rag-regression",
    version=version_timestamp,
)

result = dataset.run_experiment(
    name="prompt-v18",
    description="Candidate prompt for support RAG",
    task=task,
    evaluators=[evaluator],
)

print(result.format())
```

`get_dataset()` without `version=` returns the latest mutable state. For a reproducible release gate, obtain the chosen timestamp from the dataset version view or release configuration, pass it explicitly, and record the ISO timestamp in the experiment/run metadata and release evidence. Baseline and candidate runs must fetch the same timestamp.

> ⚠️ **Watch out:** Running two experiment comparisons at different times without pinning a dataset version means they may have silently evaluated different items — making the comparison invalid as a release gate.

Experiment runner capabilities to rely on in production:

- concurrent execution with configurable limits;
- automatic tracing of each task execution;
- item-level and run-level evaluators;
- error isolation so one failed item does not stop the full run;
- dataset-run comparison in the Langfuse UI for hosted datasets.

Layered explanation:

- Beginner intuition: an experiment is a batch test of a candidate system.
- Technical mechanics: a task function runs on each dataset item; evaluators return scores; hosted datasets create dataset runs for UI comparison.
- Production implications: experiments are release-gate evidence, not just notebooks.
- Common mistakes: evaluating on latest mutable data without recording version context, comparing runs with different datasets, and using average quality only while hiding critical failures.

Experiment design checklist:

- Define the baseline release/version and the candidate release/version.
- Use the same dataset version or record the dataset state.
- Include both common traffic and high-risk failures.
- Use deterministic evaluators where possible and calibrated judges where needed.
- Track latency, token usage, cost, safety, and quality.
- Inspect failures manually before promotion.

## 📊 Langfuse Metrics

Langfuse metrics derive from traces and scores. Use them for:

- quality trends by score
- cost by model, user, tenant tier, or prompt version
- latency by trace name and release
- volume by trace name, model, tags, or user segment
- token usage trends

Metrics API v2 is the current aggregate API:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_AUTH_STRING="$(printf '%s' "${LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY}:${LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY}" | base64 | tr -d '\n')"

curl --fail-with-body --get \
  -H "Authorization: Basic ${LANGFUSE_AUTH_STRING}" \
  --data-urlencode 'query={
    "view": "observations",
    "metrics": [{"measure": "totalCost", "aggregation": "sum"}],
    "dimensions": [{"field": "providedModelName"}],
    "filters": [{
      "column": "environment",
      "operator": "=",
      "value": "prod",
      "type": "string"
    }],
    "fromTimestamp": "2026-07-19T00:00:00Z",
    "toTimestamp": "2026-07-20T00:00:00Z",
    "orderBy": [{"field": "sum_totalCost", "direction": "desc"}],
    "config": {"row_limit": 100}
  }' \
  "${LANGFUSE_BASE_URL}/api/public/v2/metrics"
```

Use these views:

| View | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `observations` | Observation latency, cost, token, and count aggregates, with supported trace dimensions. |
| `scores-numeric` | Numeric and boolean score count/value aggregates. |
| `scores-categorical` | Categorical score counts, including the `stringValue` dimension. |

The default `config.row_limit` is 100 and the maximum is 1,000. Dimensions such as `id`, `traceId`, `userId`, and `sessionId` may be filtered but cannot be grouped because of cardinality. The v2 `observations` view counts observation rows: a trace with a root, retriever, and two generations contributes four observations. Observation counts are not trace counts; use the Observations API v2 and deduplicate `traceId` client-side when a true trace count is required.

Common dashboards:

| Dashboard | Useful charts |
| --- | --- |
| Executive AI quality | acceptance rate, groundedness, safety pass rate, cost |
| Model migration | quality, p95 latency, cost, error traces by old vs new model |
| Prompt rollout | score distributions by prompt version |
| RAG health | empty retrieval rate, groundedness, citation validity |
| Agent health | tool failure rate, step count, loop stops, final answer quality |

Layered explanation:

- Beginner intuition: metrics summarize many traces and scores.
- Technical mechanics: Langfuse derives quality, cost, latency, and volume dimensions from ingested trace/evaluation data.
- Production implications: Langfuse metrics are excellent for LLM/product analytics, while infrastructure SLOs still belong in your metrics backend.
- Common mistakes: using Langfuse as the only alert engine, not exporting quality signals to paging systems when needed, and grouping by high-cardinality metadata.
- Common mistakes: treating observation counts as trace counts, ignoring the row limit, and building a polling bridge for a threshold already supported by a native Monitor.

## 📊 Alerting Philosophy

Use a native Langfuse Monitor first for thresholds supported by observation or numeric/categorical score metrics:

1. Select `Observations`, `Scores (numeric)`, or `Scores (categorical)` and choose the aggregation/measure.
2. Add bounded filters such as environment, model, trace name, observation name, tag, release, or score name.
3. Set the alert threshold, optional warning threshold, and evaluation window.
4. Decide what no data means: compare as zero, keep the previous severity, show `NO_DATA`, or notify after sustained no data.
5. Configure renotification (`Off` or every N minutes) to avoid silent persistent incidents or notification storms.
6. Link one or more automations: Slack, an HMAC-verified webhook, or a GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`.

Monitors notify on transitions into warning/alert and on recovery; sustained severity renotifies only when configured. Treat automation delivery as production infrastructure—after repeated delivery failures a trigger can be disabled, so monitor the destination and re-enable it after repair.

Use two alert layers:

1. Native Langfuse Monitors for supported observation/score cost, latency, volume, and quality thresholds.
2. External OpenTelemetry metrics and incident tooling for infrastructure SLOs, unsupported/custom signals, cross-system correlation, on-call paging, deduplication, and escalation.

Do not page on every single bad answer. Page on sustained user impact or safety-critical failures.

## 📊 Practical Alert Ideas

| Alert | Source | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High HTTP 5xx rate | OTel metrics | Service is failing |
| High LLM provider error rate | OTel metrics or traces | Model calls are failing |
| LLM p95 latency high | OTel metrics | User experience degradation |
| Token usage per request spike | OTel metrics or Langfuse metrics | Cost or prompt regression |
| User thumbs-down rate high | Langfuse scores | Quality regression |
| Groundedness score low | Langfuse scores | RAG hallucination risk |
| Safety pass rate drops | Langfuse scores | Trust and compliance risk |
| Agent tool failure rate high | OTel metrics and Langfuse traces | Broken tools or bad plans |
| Empty retrieval rate high | OTel metrics | Search/index issue |
| Experiment regression | Langfuse experiments | Block release before production |

## 🛠️ Example: Export Quality Metrics to Alerting

If a required threshold is not supported by a native Monitor, a scheduled job can query Metrics API v2 and write compact time series to the metrics backend. Use a durable cursor, publish a monotonic processed-score counter for window sample guards, and make retries idempotent.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Protocol


@dataclass
class QualityWindow:
    trace_name: str
    score_name: str
    average: float
    count: int


class MetricsClient(Protocol):
    def gauge(self, name: str, value: float, tags: dict[str, str]) -> None:
        ...


def publish_quality_metrics(windows: list[QualityWindow], metrics: MetricsClient) -> None:
    for window in windows:
        metrics.gauge(
            "llm_quality_score",
            window.average,
            tags={
                "trace_name": window.trace_name,
                "score_name": window.score_name,
            },
        )
        metrics.gauge(
            "llm_quality_score_count",
            window.count,
            tags={
                "trace_name": window.trace_name,
                "score_name": window.score_name,
            },
        )
```

Keep alert dimensions low-cardinality. Alert by workflow, environment, release, and model; investigate individual traces in Langfuse.

## ✅ Release Gates

Before deploying a prompt, model, retrieval, or agent change:

- run dataset experiments;
- compare against the current production version;
- check quality, latency, cost, and safety scores;
- inspect failures manually;
- promote only if the candidate beats or matches current behavior on important segments;
- add a temporary production dashboard filtered by the new release/version.

This turns Langfuse from a passive trace viewer into an engineering control system.

## ✅ CI/CD Evaluation Gates

Run a small but representative experiment suite in CI for changes that affect prompts, retrieval, models, tools, or agent logic.

Gate on:

- minimum average quality score;
- no regression against the current production baseline;
- safety pass rate;
- maximum p95 latency for the test run;
- maximum token or cost budget per answer;
- no critical failures in required categories.

Example shape:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class GateScore:
    name: str
    value: float


def score_value(scores: list[GateScore], name: str) -> float:
    return next(score.value for score in scores if score.name == name)


def assert_release_gate(run_scores: list[GateScore]) -> None:
    average_relevance = score_value(run_scores, "average_relevance")
    safety_pass_rate = score_value(run_scores, "safety_pass_rate")

    if average_relevance < 0.82:
        raise SystemExit("release gate failed: relevance below threshold")

    if safety_pass_rate < 0.99:
        raise SystemExit("release gate failed: safety pass rate below threshold")
```

CI gates should be conservative and stable. Use them to block obvious regressions, then use production Langfuse dashboards and alerts to monitor the long tail.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User feedback is missing from traces | Response did not persist the Langfuse trace ID | Store `get_current_trace_id()` with the message and use `create_score()` later. |
| Scores are duplicated after retries | No idempotent score ID | Use deterministic IDs such as `<trace_id>:<score_name>:<evaluator_version>`. |
| Dashboard averages look meaningless | Mixed score scales or semantics under one name | Define score configs and version evaluator/rubric changes. |
| LLM judge disagrees with humans | Poor rubric, judge drift, or biased context | Calibrate on human-reviewed data and track disagreement. |
| Experiment passes but production fails | Dataset misses real traffic segments or hard failures | Add production failures, edge cases, and important tenant workflows to the dataset. |
| CI gates are flaky | Non-deterministic task, unstable judge, small dataset, or live provider variance | Use deterministic checks where possible, larger representative samples, and tolerance bands. |
| Alerts are noisy | Alerting on individual bad answers or low sample counts | Require sustained windows and minimum counts. |
| Quality drop is hard to investigate | Scores not tied to release/version/model/prompt dimensions | Add release/version/model metadata to traces and score metadata. |

## ✅ Evaluation Checklist

- Define the quality questions each workflow must answer.
- Choose score names, data types, constraints, and score configs before broad rollout.
- Store trace IDs with user-visible outputs so feedback can attach later.
- Use deterministic code evaluators for schema, citation, safety, and business-rule checks.
- Calibrate LLM judges against human-reviewed examples and version judge prompts.
- Build datasets from common paths, high-risk cases, and production failures.
- Run experiments before prompt, model, retrieval, or agent changes ship.
- Compare candidates against a stable baseline with quality, safety, latency, token, and cost dimensions.
- Configure native Monitors for supported sustained quality/cost/latency/volume thresholds; export compact metrics only for unsupported or cross-system alert logic.
- Keep examples, rubrics, and release gates under review as the product changes.
